> Predict daily retail sales across 54 stores and 33 product families using Prophet, XGBoost and ARIMA — with a live interactive dashboard built on real Ecuador grocery chain data.

## 🧩 Business Problem

Retail chains lose crores every year from two mistakes — overstocking (products expire) and stockouts (shelves go empty). This project solves that by forecasting daily sales per store per product family — giving procurement teams a data-driven answer to *"How much should we order next week?"*

## 📦 Dataset

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| train.csv | 3 million rows of daily sales per store per family |
| stores.csv | Store info — city, state, type, cluster |
| oil.csv | Daily Ecuador oil prices |
| holidays_events.csv | National, regional and local holidays |
| transactions.csv | Daily transaction counts per store |

- **Source** → Kaggle Store Sales Time Series Forecasting Competition
- **Period** → January 2013 to August 2017
- **Scale** → 54 stores × 33 product families × 1,684 days

## ⚙️ What Makes This Project Different

- 🔗 **Merged 6 real-world data files** using relational join keys — not a single clean CSV
- 🛢️ **Oil price as economic signal** — Ecuador's economy depends on oil exports, directly affecting consumer spending
- 📅 **3 types of seasonality validated from data** — weekly, monthly and yearly — before any feature engineering
- 🔄 **Group-aware lag features** — created within store-family groups using `groupby().shift()` to prevent group leakage
- ⏩ **Look-ahead bias prevention** — used `shift(1)` inside rolling calculations so model never sees today's sales
- 🎯 **3 models compared with business reasoning** — not just accuracy numbers

## 🧠 Feature Engineering

| Feature Type | Features Created |
|---|---|
| Lag Features | lag_7, lag_14, lag_28 |
| Rolling Averages | rolling_mean_7, rolling_mean_14, rolling_mean_28 |
| Date Features | day, week, month, quarter, year, dayofweek, is_weekend |
| External Features | oil price, is_holiday, onpromotion, transactions |
| Encoded Features | family_encoded, type_encoded |

## 🤖 Models Compared

| Model | MAPE | Level | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Prophet** | **9.98%** 🏆 | Daily Total | Business planning and trend forecasting |
| ARIMA | 11.21% | Daily Total | Statistical baseline |
| XGBoost | 47.86%* | Store + Family | Granular inventory decisions |

*XGBoost MAPE is inflated by 44% zero-sales rows in sparse retail data. RMSE of 196 is the reliable metric at store-family level.

## 💰 Business Impact

> A 1% MAPE improvement on a ₹10 Crore inventory = ₹10 Lakh saved.
> Prophet improved over ARIMA baseline from 11.21% to 9.98% — approximately ₹12 Lakh in potential savings per ₹10 Crore inventory.
